# deepops
Deep Learning Very High performance operations written to run on GPU using PyCUDA.
# Tensor
a = tensor([1,2,3,4,5])
# deepop tensor 

# Addition
a = tensor([1.0,2.0])
print(a + a)

# Contribution is highly appreciated.
Please contribute to my work.

# TODOs
write tests...
support more operations.

# lot of work ahead...
